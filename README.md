# Tic_Tac_Toe


Hi Everyone,

I have created this Tic_Tac_toe game using python by sys and Ipython.Display modules.
This is souly user interactive game while allowing two different players to play the game from the same console.
I have created four core functions in the program:-

Create_Board() - Create_Board() function basically prints the board on your console everytime you enter your choice on the board.
Player_input() - Player_input() function makes you select two choices from the ingame markers ie:-'X' and 'O'
Position_select()- Position_select function enables you to select the position on the board where you want to place the marker
Win_check()- Win_check() function is the core of the game where the function checks for the win and lose condition of both the players during each step of the game.



Any suggestions and any improvement in the program will be highly appreciated.
